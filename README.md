# pythonTask
Here you can find my first Python task

Some additional requirements are under the process and not fully completed. However its the requirements I want to add and I hope to have the second chance to be rewieved once again.

Below you can find some points on what I'm working now:

  - Rotation of logs: to create the log file name every day you run the script with the formatting'{}.{}.log' where the suffix is '%Y%m%d'
  - Improve my logging used in the scrypt by adding listener and some classes from multiprocessing module as Process, Queue, Event, current_process
  - Connect to DB by creating mine in SQLite(for example) 
  - Perform UnitTests for my script
